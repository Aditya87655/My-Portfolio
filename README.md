Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

Node.js: Download & Install Node.js (npm is included with Node.js)

Installation
Create a Project Folder:
Create a new folder for your project on your local machine. For example, aditya-portfolio.

Create package.json:
Inside your aditya-portfolio folder, create a file named package.json and paste the content from the package.json immersive artifact above.

Create public folder and index.html:
Inside your aditya-portfolio folder, create a new folder named public. Inside the public folder, create a file named index.html and paste the content from the public/index.html immersive artifact above.

Create src folder and files:
Inside your aditya-portfolio folder, create a new folder named src.

Inside the src folder, create a file named index.js and paste the content from the src/index.js immersive artifact above.

Inside the src folder, create a file named App.jsx and paste the content from the src/App.jsx immersive artifact above.

Install Dependencies:
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your aditya-portfolio project folder, and run the following command to install the necessary packages:

npm install

Running the Application Locally
After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

npm start

This command will:

Start a development server.

Open your portfolio website in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).

Automatically reload the page when you make changes to the code.

Customization
Update Content: Replace placeholder text, images (https://placehold.co/...), and links (#) with your actual information, project details, and social media profiles.

Add Your Photo: In src/App.jsx, locate the img tag in the "About Me" section and replace the src attribute with the URL or path to your professional photo.

Add More Projects/Experience: Simply add more ProjectCard or ExperienceCard components within their respective sections in src/App.jsx.

Tailwind CSS: If you wish to customize Tailwind's configuration (e.g., add custom colors, fonts, or plugins), you would typically create a tailwind.config.js file and run a build process. For this CDN-based setup, direct Tailwind classes are used.

Deployment
Once you're happy with your portfolio, you can create a production-ready build.

npm run build

This command will:

Create a build folder in your project directory.

Optimize your React application for production (minifies code, optimizes assets, etc.).

You can then deploy the contents of this build folder to any static site hosting service, such as:

GitHub Pages: Excellent for personal portfolios.

Netlify: Easy to use, integrates well with GitHub.

Vercel: Popular for React and Next.js applications.

Firebase Hosting: Google's hosting solution.

Example for GitHub Pages:
Make sure your project is a Git repository (git init if not already).

Commit your changes.

Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., aditya-portfolio).

Push your local repository to GitHub.

Install gh-pages package: npm install gh-pages --save-dev

Add the following to your package.json (replace your-github-username with your actual GitHub username):

"homepage": "https://your-github-username.github.io/aditya-portfolio",
"scripts": {
  // ... existing scripts
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}

Run the deploy command: npm run deploy

This will publish your build folder to a gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository, making your portfolio accessible at the homepage URL.
